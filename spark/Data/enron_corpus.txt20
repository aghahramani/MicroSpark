t, its shares fell a further 28 percent, after falling 23 percent on Tuesda=
y.
"If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation se=
ems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible," rating agency Fit=
ch Investors said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone said "bankruptcy would not be out of the que=
stion" if the merger fell through or ran into obstacles.=20
"We believe the odds of Enron incurring a material adverse change on its op=
erations is soaring," Barone said in a research note, saying that Dynegy ma=
y invoke clauses allowing it to walk away from or alter the terms of the $9=
 billion agreement.=20
In a statement, Enron said it was in feverish talks with its other lenders =
to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to the Dy=
negy deal.=20
"We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our sh=
areholders, employees and lenders," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenn=
eth Lay said.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James Lee said in the same statement =
that Chase believes its interests and those of Enron and its other primary =
lenders are aligned, and that the bank would "develop a plan to strengthen =
Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy."=20
Enron's shares fell $1.98 to close at $5.01. It was the most actively trade=
d issue on the New York Stock Exchange for a second day in a row.=20
The shares had dipped as low as $4.55 on Wednesday, rebounding slightly aft=
er Enron's announcement. Accounting for stock splits, that is the lowest En=
ron has traded since February 1989.=20
Dynegy shares were off $1.94, or 4.65 percent, at $39.76.=20
Dynegy on board=20
Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new loan =
and debt extension. Watson said in a statement that Dynegy was working to "=
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger."=20
Watson said ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, reiterate=
d its "full confidence" in Dynegy's ability to complete the merger.=20
However, Dynegy officials worried Wednesday that even discussing the idea o=
f renegotiating the merger agreement could damage confidence in Enron among=
 investors and other energy traders.=20
An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal=
 grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally. Nor, he added, was Dyn=
egy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed=
.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said that she was not aware of any attempts by Dynegy =
to renegotiate the deal.=20
Privately, analysts were calling the odds of success lower since Enron made=
 a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday alerting in=
vestors to its credit crunch.=20
Monday's filing noted that Enron's financial woes have led to a "reduced le=
vel of transaction activity" with the company by trading partners.=20
Most analysts interviewed by Reuters called the chances of the deal even, w=
here earlier they had listed odds of success at 60 percent to 70 percent.=
=20
However, one analyst said he thought emotion was driving the current stock =
moves, and that it comes despite three powerful factors in favor of the dea=
l.=20
"The bottom line, Enron needs this to happen, Dynegy wants this to happen, =
and ChevronTexaco is supportive of it happening," Credit Suisse First Bosto=
n analyst Curt Launer said.=20
Trading deals down=20
Goldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to "market perform," and took bot=
h off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dynegy--$1.=
5 billion--"appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron customers=
."=20
Enron's trading partners said they were treading carefully.=20
"We've been scaling back for some time, but we're still dealing with Enron.=
 Every day, our credit people are watching," said Al Butkus, a vice preside=
nt with Kansas City-based UtiliCorp United Inc.=20
The trading business, Enron's crown jewel and the part most coveted by Dyne=
gy, relies on volume for profitability, and Enron has said it was possible =
that the lower volumes would hamper fourth- quarter earnings.=20
One indicator of Enron's shape was the fact that its bonds are being quoted=
 by price, like junk bonds, rather than by how much extra yield they carry =
over U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.=20
The company's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes mat=
uring in 2009 were respectively bid Wednesday afternoon at 62 and 60 cents =
on the dollar, each down from the high 60s on Tuesday. Their yields to matu=
rity were a respective 19 and 16 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertib=
le bonds traded Wednesday at just over 34 cents on the dollar, down from 38=
 cents on Tuesday.

U.S. Watchdog Group Refuses Inquiry of Enron Audit Woes

WASHINGTON -- An accounting industry watchdog won't investigate auditing pr=
oblems at Enron Corp. despite a request from a senior U.S. lawmaker, but ma=
y take a broader look at what's causing recent audit debacles.=20
"Investigation of the Enron situation rests with the SEC," Public Oversight=
 Board Chairman Charles Bowsher said. "We can't run a separate investigatio=
n."
The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining accounting and audit pr=
oblems at Houston-based Enron, focusing on investments in limited partnersh=
ips tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Enron has acknowl=
edged it overstated net income by $586 million (663.8 million euros) and wi=
ll need to restate five years of financial reports.=20
Citing concerns about the accounting industry's peer-review process, Rep. J=
ohn Dingell asked the Public Oversight Board to conduct a special investiga=
tion of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audit work for Enron.=20
Mr. Bowsher said the oversight board won't open a special investigation, le=
aving that to the SEC and the industry's quality-control inquiry committee,=
 but will decide at its next meeting whether to take "a hard look" at recen=
t, high-profile audit blowups.=20
"We're probably going to want to look at some of these major audit failures=
, and that's not limited to Andersen," Mr. Bowsher said.=20
He cited recent audit failures involving Cendant Corp., Microstrategy Inc.,=
 Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Management Inc., saying "I think we ought to look =
at them all."=20
Former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner expressed disappointment at the ove=
rsight board's reluctance to exercise its investigative muscle, given a ras=
h of financial restatements and frauds that have cost investors more than $=
100 billion in recent years.=20
"In light of losses that have reached the magnitude of the savings-and-loan=
 debacle, it's time for the POB to start carrying out investigations of wha=
t's happening at the audit firms," Mr. Turner said.=20
He said Rep. Dingell is right to question the accounting profession's abili=
ty to police itself through so-called peer reviews, saying recent audit fai=
lures "are evidence that the peer-review process is not as robust as it nee=
ds to be."=20
Firms that audit public companies must undergo peer review every three year=
s, subjecting their work to scrutiny by a competing audit firm or a panel a=
ppointed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In prac=
tice, the Big Five firms hire each other to conduct the oversight, with no =
requirement to rotate assignments, and critics say reviewers aren't as toug=
h as they could or should be.=20
"There's a tendency in the peer reviews, even when problems are identified,=
 to regard them as isolated instances," not evidence of a systemic failure =
at an audit firm, said Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruc=
h College in New York.=20
Mr. Bowsher defends peer reviews as "a very rigorous, thorough process," bu=
t concedes they haven't prevented a recent bout of problematic audits. He s=
uggested that may be due to factors from bad judgment on the part of indivi=
dual partners to questions about applying accounting and auditing standards=
.=20
In Enron's case, the quality-control inquiry committee, composed of about a=
 dozen CPAs, will investigate Andersen's audit work but critics doubt it wi=
ll do much digging.

Employees' Retirement Plan Is a Victim as Enron Tumbles
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

11/22/2001
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company=20

The rapid decline of the Enron Corporation has devastated its employees' re=
tirement plan, which was heavy with company stock, and has infuriated worke=
rs, who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunge=
d.=20
Through the 401(k) retirement plan, employees chose to put much of their sa=
vings in Enron shares, and the company made contributions in company stock =
as well. But around the time Enron disclosed serious financial problems las=
t month, the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrat=
ive change. For several weeks, as the stock lost much of its value, workers=
 stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated. They were not =
allowed to switch investments at all -- even though the plan had far less r=
isky choices.
The unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for Enron's workers. At the end =
of last year, the 401(k) plan had $2.1 billion in assets. More than half wa=
s invested in Enron, an energy conglomerate. Since then, the stock has lost=
 94 percent of its value.=20
At Portland General Electric, the Oregon utility acquired by Enron four yea=
rs ago, some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of =
dollars. The utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work throug=
h their problems.=20
''We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 =
or $900,000,'' said Steve Lacey, an emergency-repair dispatcher for Portlan=
d General. ''It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan.''=20
''Shortly after it was frozen, the articles started coming out about some o=
f the questionable activities of Enron,'' Mr. Lacey added. ''The stock took=
 a tremendous drop, and we were pretty much helpless.''=20
The loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on =
one investment. Stock plunges similar to Enron's have also wiped out the re=
tirement savings of many employees of the Nortel Networks Corporation, Luce=
nt Technologies Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd.=20
The loss by Enron's workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits ma=
de by some senior Enron executives, who sold stock during the last few year=
s. Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, made $20.7 million during the first se=
ven months of 2001 by exercising stock options -- and more than $180 millio=
n by exercising options during the three prior years. Last week, Mr. Lay ag=
reed to forgo a $60 million severance package after Enron traders and emplo=
yees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed =
acquisition of the company by Dynegy Inc. while they were suffering.=20
Enron -- which is already the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on investigation of transactions among Enron and partnerships headed by the=
 company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, and a number o=
f shareholders' suits -- now has an additional legal problem.=20
On Tuesday, Steve W. Berman, a lawyer from Seattle who represented states a=
gainst the tobacco industry, filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in H=
ouston seeking class-action status on behalf of Enron employees who lost mo=
ney on the stock through their retirement plan. The lawsuit says that Enron=
 schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fi=
duciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests.=20
''They were promoting Enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching=
 employees' contributions with Enron stock, when they knew the stock was ov=
ervalued, and that's a breach of their fiduciary duties,'' Mr. Berman said =
in an interview yesterday.=20
What's more, he said, the assets were frozen on Oct. 17, with the stock at =
$32.20, even though Enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosur=
es about the company's accounting practices. ''They knew the worst news was=
 about to come out, but they froze the stock,'' he said.=20
Enron closed yesterday at $5.01.=20
The company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pendi=
ng litigation. A spokeswoman, Karen Denne, said that the change in plan adm=
inistrators had been in the works for a number of months and that she did n=
ot know the exact date the change was put into effect.=20
Like many other big companies, Enron made its contributions to the plan in =
company shares. But employees also chose to put much of their own contribut=
ions into the stock, lured by its stellar past performance. The company say=
s that 89 percent of the Enron stock in the plan wound up there because emp=
loyees chose it, and 11 percent was the company's contribution.=20
''A lot of people believed in the stock, so it wasn't just the company matc=
h,'' said an employee at Enron's headquarters in downtown Houston. ''It was=
 their own money, too. People are just shell-shocked.''=20
The stock's past performance had lured many workers. Last year, as the stoc=
k soared, total assets in the 401(k) plan rose more than 35 percent.=20
About 57 percent of Enron's 21,000 employees participate in the 401(k) plan=
. The company generally matches employee contributions at 50 cents on the d=
ollar, up to 6 percent of their salary, with Enron stock, which cannot be s=
old and put into another investment until the employee reaches age 50. But =
Ms. Denne said workers otherwise ''have a range of options'' in which to in=
vest their money.=20
Gerry O'Connor, a senior consultant with the Spectrem Group, a consulting f=
irm based in Chicago, said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze asse=
ts when administrators were switched. ''If you don't, you can wind up with =
misallocated money, wrong statements, and all kinds of complicating factors=
,'' he said.=20
But a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many =
specialists in retirement planning. Employees are taking ''a lot of risk, b=
ut they don't think of it as such,'' Mr. O'Connor said.=20
''They say, 'You know, I work for this company, and we're doing great.' ''=
=20
In addition to the swoon in their 401(k) plans, Enron employees have watche=
d the value of their stock options wither. Enron gave a far larger percenta=
ge of employees options than most companies do, but now, with the fall in E=
nron shares, nearly all of those options are worthless.=20
Enron's tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its wo=
rkers in Oregon. About 95 percent of the 2,700 employees of Portland Genera=
l, which Enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash, =
are invested in the 401(k) plan, said Scott Simms, a spokesman.=20
The losses, he added, have hit everyone ''including officers all the way th=
rough to other staff.''=20
''It's certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and=
 others haven't,'' he said. ''It was the same plan for everyone.''=20
In an interview with The Oregonian in Portland, Peggy Y. Fowler, Portland G=
eneral's chief executive, said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincide=
nce. ''The timing couldn't have been worse,'' she said.=20
''We refer to our retirement program as a three-legged stool -- Social Secu=
rity, the company pension and the 401(k),'' Ms. Fowler said. ''One of the l=
egs has been cut off.''

Circling the Wagons Around Enron
Risks Too Great To Let Trader Just Die
By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and RIVA D. ATLAS

11/22/2001
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company=20

Officials of Dynegy yesterday weighed whether to seek to renegotiate the te=
rms of the company's agreement to acquire Enron, its Houston rival, while E=
nron and its bankers sought to shore up its finances, executives close to t=
he two companies said.=20
The discussions came as the stock and energy markets continued to register =
doubts about the financial stability of Enron, the energy trading concern. =
Enron's stock fell another 27 percent, even though the company won a three-=
week reprieve from its banks on a $690 million note that would have come du=
e next Tuesday if Enron had been unable to come up with collateral.
An executive close to Enron described the loan extension, by J. P. Morgan C=
hase and Citigroup, as a Band-Aid, given the approach of Thanksgiving. ''Pe=
ople are trying to take the time to come up with something for the intermed=
iate term,'' the executive added.=20
The bankers also met with investors, including leveraged buyout firms and t=
wo industrial companies, which might inject up to $2 billion into Enron und=
er arrangements that would protect them from a further collapse in the comp=
any's stock, the executives said.=20
The new investments would be in Enron's Transwestern Pipeline, which links =
natural gas fields in Texas to the California market, they said. The deals =
would be structured like Dynegy's agreement, as part of the merger, to infu=
se $1.5 billion into the Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Ga=
s pipeline. That arrangement lets Dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merg=
er falls apart.=20
Besides talking with other potential investors, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citi=
group agreed to terms that have each taking a $250 million equity stake in =
such a deal, the executives said. The bankers plan to meet with Enron offic=
ials on Monday to complete the transactions, they added.=20
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, noted that the company had previously sa=
id it was seeking a further infusion of up to $1 billion in equity. ''We ar=
e not going to discuss the specifics of who we are talking to,'' she said.=
=20
Though investors again manhandled the stock of Enron, which is down 94 perc=
ent this year, the banks, Dynegy and credit-rating agencies all sought to p=
roceed delicately. Executives explained that hasty moves could only deepen =
the crisis of confidence in Enron, wiping out the energy trading operations=
 that only months ago made it one of the nation's most admired and politica=
lly influential companies.=20
Dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating th=
e merger deal could damage confidence in Enron among investors and other en=
ergy traders.=20
An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal=
 grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally. Nor, he added, was Dyn=
egy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed=
. But he indicated that the situation could change.=20
Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said that she was not aware of any attemp=
ts by Dynegy to renegotiate the deal. Dynegy issued a statement saying that=
 its chief executive, Chuck Watson, was encouraged by the steps Enron had t=
aken with its bankers. Mr. Watson said the company was continuing its due d=
iligence on the deal.=20
Dynegy's shares, which rose as high as $46.94 in the days after the merger =
was announced, on Nov. 9, closed yesterday at $39.76, down more than 4 perc=
ent for the second consecutive day.=20
Enron was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, cl=
osing at $5.01, down $1.98. That means the premium that Dynegy would be pay=
ing for Enron has risen to 115 percent.=20
Analysts following Enron's debt said that bankers had little choice but to =
support the company, given that most of Enron's bank debt is not secured. T=
hat means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy, they would receive =
no better treatment than the holders of more than $6 billion in Enron bonds=
 and other debt.=20
Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure $9.15 billion in deb=
t that will come due by the end of 2002. ''If the Dynegy deal closed, that =
would be the best thing for the banks,'' said one analyst following the deb=
t.=20
James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, echoed that thought =
in a statement issued by Enron. ''We believe the interests of Chase and Enr=
on's other primary lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' he s=
aid. ''We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a p=
lan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger w=
ith Dynegy.'' Along with Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase is Enron's lead bank=
, and it is also an adviser on the merger with Dynegy.=20
Another group with the power to push Enron to the brink, the big credit-rat=
ing agencies, continued to step gingerly. The agencies have held Enron's de=
bt rating one step above ''junk'' status, knowing that downgrading it furth=
er would force the company to pay or refinance up to $3.9 billion in debt -=
- effectively rendering Enron insolvent. One rating agency official said ye=
sterday that such a move would roil the entire debt market, adding that it =
was ''patriotic'' to hold off.=20
Still, one rating agency, Fitch, put out a strongly worded commentary yeste=
rday.=20
''If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation s=
eems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible,'' wrote Ralph Pel=
lecchia and Glen Grabelsky, the Fitch analysts following Enron. ''Our prese=
nt BBB- rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the=
 lending banks, without which Fitch would consider lowering the rating.''=
=20
Analysts and energy executives said that Enron's collapse -- though unthink=
able just weeks ago -- would be unlikely to cause a meltdown in the nation'=
s energy markets. While Enron has been the nation's biggest trader of elect=
ric power and natural gas, many other companies -- including Dynegy -- make=
 markets in those commodities. Analysts say the gradual unfolding of Enron'=
s financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind de=
als and limit their exposure to Enron.=20
Yet even one of Enron's most stubborn supporters was forced to concede yest=
erday that his confidence had been shattered by the company's problems, inc=
luding the rapid depletion of its cash reserves, restatements that erased $=
600 million in earnings and the surprise disclosure of the $690 million deb=
t.=20
That fan, Goldman, Sachs & Company's energy analyst, David Fleischer, downg=
raded the shares to neutral. Until yesterday, Goldman had kept the stock on=
 its recommended list.

On the days it was cold and damp, utility lineman Roy Rinard would think ab=
out the future.=20
His hip hurt from arthritis, and his lungs hurt from sarcoidosis, but Rinar=
d knew on days like that he'd be climbing poles for only four or five more =
years.
That's because the 54-year-old was pumping every dime he could into his 401=
(k) plan at work and getting a dollar-for-dollar match. And the money was p=
iling up in the 21 years he worked there.=20
Earlier this year, Rinard had $472,000 in his 401(k) plan. Today, it's wort=
h about $40,000.=20
That's because Rinard is a lineman with Enron-owned Portland General Electr=
ic in Portland, Ore.=20
In January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a sh=
are.=20
Part of the reason that Rinard lost so much money is that Enron gives its e=
mployees their 401(k) match in company stock. That was great when the stock=
 was flying high but as the stock has tanked, employee retirement accounts =
have evaporated.=20
It's fairly common for employers to give their 401(k) match in their own co=
mpany stock, said Scott Alt, assistant vice president of Aon Consulting, a =
human resources consulting firm in Houston.=20
It's often cheaper for a company to provide stock because they don't have t=
o put out the cash, said Alt, who sets up 401(k) plans for companies.=20
And giving stock makes the employees shareholders, which many executives be=
lieves breed loyalty. They work a little harder when they own the company, =
Alt said.=20
And employees like it -- except, of course, if the stock plummets.=20
At Enron, the problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard,=
 saw Enron's stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire acco=
unt into Enron stock.=20
Enron executives were talking about how the stock price was poised to climb=
 above $100 a share, he recalled. It was going to $120.=20
Rinard and a co-worker, Steve Lacey, have filed an Employee Retirement Inco=
me Security Act, or ERISA, lawsuit in Houston contending that Enron reckles=
sly endangered their retirement funds.=20
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle=
, said Enron touted the value of its stock and encouraged employees to put =
their entire portfolio into Enron stock.=20
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation=
 as positive, especially when things were going downhill, said Berman, who =
is hoping to get the suit certified as a class-action case.=20
He's hoping to prove that the 401(k) plan executives failed to act responsi=
bly when they knew about serious business problems.=20
Berman is hoping to break some new legal ground with his case. It's pattern=
ed after a case against Lucent Technologies in which Lucent employees sued =
their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) contributions with com=
pany stock that later tanked. That case is still in litigation.=20
Another troubling feature of the Enron 401(k) plan was that employees were =
not allowed to make trades for about a month. Unfortunately, the lockdown b=
egan Oct. 17, the day after Enron surprised the market that it was taking a=
 $1.01 billion after-tax third-quarter charge to get out of bad investments=
.=20
Enron officials, who did not return a telephone call for this column, have =
said they had planned the lockdown for several months because it was changi=
ng plan administrators.=20
But that timing was disastrous for Rinard and his co-workers who couldn't s=
ell their shares between the time it was $33.84 a share on Oct. 16 and when=
 they could begin to trade again at less than $10 a share.=20
"I just watched it drop, horrified," Rinard said. "There wasn't a thing I c=
ould do about it."=20
Like many employees, Rinard's 401(k) retirement fund was the only thing he =
had. And now Rinard is kicking himself for trusting his company too much.=
=20
Before the wheels came off the wagon, retirement was a doable thing, Rinard=
 said. The end was in sight.=20
"Now, after 35 years of climbing poles, I'm just right back to where I star=
ted."

Enron Shares Fall Again on Doubts Energy: A retreat by bankers or a credit =
downgrade could threaten Dynegy merger and land firm in bankruptcy. Stock t=

NEW YORK -- Investors pounded shares of Enron Corp. to a 12-year low Wednes=
day amid mounting doubts about whether the Houston-based energy-trading kin=
g can survive long enough to complete its announced takeover by cross-town =
rival Dynegy Inc.=20
Enron shares plunged $1.98, or 28%, to close at $5.01 in New York Stock Exc=
hange trading, its lowest level since April 1989. Enron, a Wall Street darl=
ing just months ago, is down 94% year-to-date.
A minefield stands between Enron and the merger, analysts said. Almost any =
stumble--a further downgrade by a credit rating agency, a retreat by Enron'=
s bankers or trading partners, another negative surprise about its financia=
l condition--could pitch it into bankruptcy.=20
Still, the credit rating agencies held their fire Wednesday, keeping Enron'=
s bonds one notch above "junk," or sub-investment-grade, status.=20
Enron also gained some breathing space from its lenders, announcing that a =
$690-million note payment due Tuesday had been postponed to mid-December.=
=20
"I think they'll probably limp through [to the merger]," said analyst Micha=
el S. Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. "But it's a bad limp."=
=20
There were no major new disclosures to prompt Wednesday's sell-off, but inv=
estors seemed to be afraid to hold Enron stock over the Thanksgiving weeken=
d, traders said. The stock market is closed today and open Friday for an ab=
breviated session--traditionally the lightest trading day of the year.=20
Enron shares plummeted 23% on Tuesday in reaction to a filing Monday with t=
he Securities and Exchange Commission in which Enron disclosed the $690-mil=
lion obligation. The disclosure was a surprise even to the credit rating ag=
encies that have been in constant contact with Enron executives since the c=
ompany's finances began unraveling last month.=20
The rating agencies' view is critical, because under some controversial Enr=
on deals that have come to light recently, a downgrade to junk level would =
be a "trigger event" requiring Enron to immediately pay $3.9 billion to cre=
ditors, the company said in Monday's SEC filing.=20
Such an event could instantly bankrupt the company, analysts said.=20
Enron has been reeling since mid-October, when it began disclosing details =
of deals involving limited partnerships organized by current or former comp=
any executives. The partnerships' purpose appears partly to have been to pu=
mp up Enron's reported profit while concealing large amounts of debt it was=
 incurring.=20
The SEC has announced that it is investigating the situation.=20
In addition to announcing the delayed payment, Enron said Wednesday that it=
 had tapped the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1-billion=
 credit line from its chief lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup =
Inc.=20
Enron probably can restructure its debts and postpone most payments until M=
ay, analyst Ronald M. Barone of Standard & Poor's rating agency said Wednes=
day. It is in the lenders' interest to cooperate, as much of Enron's debt i=
s unsecured by hard assets, and the banks would stand to lose most of their=
 principal in a bankruptcy, he said.=20
Dynegy broke its recent silence Wednesday by issuing a statement in which C=
hairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was "encouraged" by the ne=
ws of Enron's agreements with its lenders.=20
Dynegy is "working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to compl=
ete the merger," Watson said, adding that oil giant ChevronTexaco Corp., wh=
ich owns 26% of Dynegy's stock, reiterated its support for the deal.=20
Ratcheting up the pressure on Enron, another credit rating agency, Fitch In=
c., issued a statement Wednesday listing its own concerns. Enron's energy t=
rading partners seem to be demanding more cash collateral and reducing thei=
r exposure to Enron, which calls into question the ongoing value of the com=
pany's core trading business, Fitch said.=20
Although Dynegy has reiterated its intention to complete the merger, Enron'=
s problems make renegotiating the merger terms or canceling the deal a poss=
ibility, Fitch said.=20
"If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation se=
ems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible," Fitch said.=20
If the merger falls through, Dynegy still will retain the right to purchase=
 Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline system for $1.5 billion.=20
However, analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said he believes Dyn=
egy still is mainly interested in the trading franchise.=20
"I don't think it's worth Dynegy's while to go through all this pain if the=
y just want to pick up assets [such as the pipeline] on the cheap," Meade s=
aid.

Enron Stock Declines Further On Release of Regulatory Filing --- Document R=
eveals Potential Fresh Problems

Enron Corp.'s stock and bond prices took another beating after the energy c=
ompany's release late Monday of its much-anticipated third-quarter financia=
l filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This revealed po=
tentially major new cash-flow and earnings headaches.=20
As of 4 p.m. in New York Tuesday, Enron shares were at $6.99, down $2.07, o=
r 23%. Enron once again topped the exchange's most-active list with 89.9 mi=
llion shares traded, more than twice the volume of the next most active sto=
ck.
Enron bond prices fell into the range of between 70 cents and 80 cents on t=
he dollar, according to market observers. Following the announcement earlie=
r this month of Dynegy Inc.'s plan to buy Enron for around $10 billion in s=
tock, bond prices had firmed to above 80 cents on the dollar.=20
A Dynegy spokesman Tuesday wouldn't comment on the status of the pending ac=
quisition, other than to say his company was reviewing Enron's third-quarte=
r financial report, filed with the SEC, as part of continuing "due diligenc=
e." Under the proposed acquisition, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 of its sha=
res for each Enron share. Based on Dynegy's 4 p.m. price Tuesday of $41.70 =
a share, off $1.90, the deal values Enron shares at about $11.20 -- well ab=
ove the current market price.=20
Monday's third-quarter financial report from Enron, which supplemented and =
revised Enron's earnings announcement last month, reinforced fears that the=
 energy-trading company is in a "precarious financial position and will be =
for awhile," said Andre Meade, head of U.S. utility research at Commerzbank=
 Securities.=20
Enron's SEC filing Monday said that because of the company's deteriorated c=
redit standing, it might have to repay a $690 million note by this coming M=
onday. The filing also said Enron might be forced to take a $700 million pr=
etax charge to earnings in the current quarter, ending Dec. 31, due to a dr=
op in value of some of its assets.=20
Houston-based Enron has been in deepening financial distress for the past m=
onth, since announcing big asset and shareholder-equity reductions in the t=
hird quarter.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron granted breathing space - US energy grou=
p postpones $690m in repayments as it fights for survival.=20
Enron, the crisis-hit US energy trader, won a stay of execution from its le=
nders yesterday but remained on a knife edge as it struggled to restore the=
 confidence of customers, bankers and investors.
The former stock market star said repayment of $690m ( #479m) of outstandin=
g notes would be postponed from next Tuesday to "mid-December". The group a=
lso said it had finalised the remaining $450m of a $1bn credit line from JP=
 Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney, part of Citigroup.=20
Enron's survival is crucial to the smooth functioning of the US energy mark=
et, which the group dominates. Its failure would also have severe repercuss=
ions in the wider financial markets, where Enron offsets much of the risk o=
f energy price changes.=20
Negotiations with lenders are set to continue through today's Thanksgiving =
holiday, according to people close to the talks.=20
Whether Enron can survive depends on the commitment of Dynegy, rival US ene=
rgy group, to its $9bn rescue takeover bid, announced two weeks ago. Dynegy=
 said yesterday it was "encouraged" that Enron had progressed in boosting i=
ts liquidity and it was continuing the "due diligence" review of Enron's op=
erations.=20
Some analysts believe Enron will burn through its cash balances of $1.2bn b=
efore the Dynegy deal can be completed next year.=20
David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs, one of the last remaining bulls on Enron,=
 downgraded the stock yesterday, pointing out that cash balances were inade=
quate to pay off debt obligations of $2.8bn by the end of the year.=20
One person close to the talks with lenders said Enron had a medium-term pla=
n for restructuring $9.15bn of debt due by the end of next year. Jimmy Lee,=
 vice-chairman of JP Morgan Chase, said the bank would work to "strengthen =
Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy".=20
In morning trading yesterday, Enron's stock fell 33 per cent before it anno=
unced the extension of the $690m repayment. The group's bonds had also fall=
en to levels that suggested Enron faced bankruptcy.=20
By lunchtime in New York the stock had recovered slightly and was trading a=
t $4.97, 29 per cent lower on the day. The shares started the week at $9, b=
ut a regulatory filing by Enron on Monday that detailed the extent of its d=
ebt prompted traders to limit exposure before Thanksgiving.=20

Lenders throw Enron lifeline but Dynegy is main rescue hope
NEIL HUME I N NEW YORK

Enron, the debt-stricken energy trading group that owns Wessex Water, was t=
hrown a lifeline yesterday by its lenders who postponed the repayment of a =
$690m (pounds 487m) loan due next week. But its survival still depends on w=
hether its smaller rival Dynegy goes ahead with its $9.6bn rescue takeover.=
=20
Last night Dynegy said it was encouraged by the agreement and was seeking w=
ays to speed up regulatory clearance of the deal that would create the domi=
nant force in US energy trading.
Enron shares, which touched $4.55 - their lowest price since February 1989 =
- before the banks announced that the repayment deadline would be extended =
from next Tuesday to mid-December, were down in afternoon trading yesterday=
 by $1.74 at $5.25.=20
Enron also said it had drawn down the remaining $450m of a $1bn secured cre=
dit line from JP Morgan and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.=20
"We have been in contact with our banks and believe we can identify a mutua=
lly beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position, strengthen our b=
alance sheet and address upcoming maturities," said Jeffrey McMahon, Enron'=
s chief financial officer=20
This week, Enron shares went into yet another free fall following the publi=
cation of a third-quarter filing with the securities and exchange commissio=
n in which the company warned that last week's credit rating downgrade by S=
tandard & Poor's would trigger the repayment of the $690m loan on Tuesday. =
Enron also revealed it would have to repay $9.15bn of debt by the end of ne=
xt year.=20
That news sparked fears that Enron might run out of cash before the Dynegy =
takeover. Both firms estimated it could take six to nine months to gain reg=
ulatory approval without special dispensation.=20
Dynegy is offering 0.2685 shares for each Enron share and under the terms o=
f the deal can walk away if Enron's problems turn out to be worse than prev=
iously thought.=20
Yesterday's agreements will help restore confidence among Enron's customers=
, seen as the key to the deal. The energy trading division is Enron's main =
profit engine and the major attraction for Dynegy.=20
In the past two months Enron has suffered a fall from grace. It shares have=
 lost 90% of their value since it sacked its finance director Andrew Fastow=
 in October for unusual transactions carried out off balance sheet. These f=
orced it to take a $1bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $1.2bn.=20
To shore up its financial position, Enron is likely to sell Wessex Water, f=
or which it paid pounds 1.4bn in 1998, and a number of gas-fired power stat=
ions, including the high performing 1,900MW Teesside plant.

Dynegy aims for quick merger with Enron
by Padraic Cassidy

Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC=20

Prompted by Enron's recent stock sell off, Houston energy trader Dynegy is =
trying to quicken the pace of the companies' $24 billion merger.=20
After watching Enron Corp.'s stock plummet at the start of a short holiday =
week, Houston energy trader Dynegy Inc. said Wednesday it would try to quic=
ken the pace of the companies' $24 billion merger.
Prompting Dynegy's statement was Enron's announcement that it closed on $45=
0 million of a promised $1 billion line of financing from J.P. Morgan Chase=
 & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., secured by the assets of its subsidia=
ry, Northern Natural Gas Co.=20
Dynegy, which has agreed to acquire crosstown rival Enron in an all-stock d=
eal, said it was encouraged by the development and was working to accelerat=
e the transaction.=20
The companies announced Nov. 9 their intent to merge in a deal that was val=
ued at $24 billion, including $13 billion in Enron debt.=20
Enron's stock price has plummeted since the company acknowledged the Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission was investigating its financial disclosures an=
d trading activities.=20
Dynegy said the financing terms also pleased ChevronTexaco Corp., which own=
s 29% of Dynegy.=20
ChevronTexaco agreed to pump $2.5 billion of new equity into Dynegy, $1.5 b=
illion of which immediately will be channeled into Enron and $1 billion at =
closing.=20
Dynegy will use the initial $1.5 billion to acquire preferred stock and oth=
er rights in an Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipelin=
e system. The funds will give Enron additional cash liquidity to support it=
s operations.=20
Enron, which last week closed on $650 million of financing secured by its T=
ranswestern Pipeline Co., also said it is in discussions with its primary l=
enders to make a formal postponement to mid-December of a $690 million paym=
ent that is due Tuesday.=20
"We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary lenders are al=
igned in this restructuring effort," said James B. Lee, vice chairman of J.=
P. Morgan.=20

Enron Tries to Pacify Worries as More Investors Decide to Sell Shares

 Reporter (TM)=20

Faltering Houston energy trader Enron Corp. tried to calm investors' worrie=
s Wednesday, announcing progress in relieving its debt situation, but its s=
tock lost a quarter of its value for the second day in a row.=20
At one point Wednesday, shares hit a 12-year low, touching $4.55.
The stock partially recovered after the company said it negotiated a three-=
week extension on a $690 million note that became due next week after the c=
ompany's debt rating deteriorated.=20
Enron also said it closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously ann=
ounced $1 billion line of credit and is trying to restructure other debt.=
=20
Still, counting debts owed at the parent company and a subsidiary, Enron ne=
eds to raise nearly $1 billion to pay off notes coming due in the next mont=
h or so, said Scott Keller, an analyst at DealAnalytics.com.=20
Shares closed at $5.01, down $1.98, or 28 percent, in New York Stock Exchan=
ge trading.=20
Around 115.6 million shares changed hands, making it the most active stock =
on U.S. exchanges Wednesday.=20
Until its recent downfall, Enron was regarded as a high-flier among energy =
companies, having diversified from its natural gas roots to the electricity=
 trading and telecommunications industries. The stock hit a 52-week high of=
 $84.88 late last year.=20
An investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission this fall led to=
 the restatement of Enron's earnings back to 1997 and the disclosure of a n=
umber of complex and questionable partnerships -- some run by the company's=
 chief financial officer.=20
Mr. Keller said Wednesday that it's crucial that a special committee appoin=
ted by the company's board complete an internal investigation of financial =
dealings that prompted the SEC probe.=20
"Once your short-term liquidity runs out, it doesn't matter who wants to bu=
y you," Mr. Keller said=20
Although both Enron and Dynegy reaffirmed their commitment to a merger Wedn=
esday, analysts said Enron could be facing a bankruptcy filing long before =
a buyout if it doesn't restore enough confidence to raise the funds it need=
s.=20
The merger deal between Dynegy and Enron -- announced Nov. 9 --allows Dyneg=
y to back out of the transaction should there be a "material adverse change=
" in conditions.=20
Houston-based Dynegy could also decide to renegotiate the terms of the deal=
, which currently prices Enron at about $11 a share.=20
Considering Enron's credit problems and the growing number of companies can=
celing transactions with the energy trader, analysts are increasingly uncer=
tain that the deal will close at any price.=20
"What Dynegy is buying more than anything else is the trading operations," =
said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg. "A week ago, I would have said t=
here was a 90 percent chance that this deal would go through. Now, I would =
say it's 50-50."=20
Early Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock. CIBC Wo=
rld Markets also cut Enron to a "hold" from a "buy."=20
And Mr. Youngberg lowered his rating to "sell" late Tuesday.=20
"Individual investors who are buying the stock now are really gambling with=
 their money," he said.=20
Indeed, those who are still holding Enron stock are in an all-or-nothing gu=
essing game, analysts said. Should they sell out now or hold on with the ho=
pe that the Dynegy deal will go through before Enron faces bankruptcy?=20
Lately, investors have been deciding in droves to sell. Enron has logged an=
 average daily trading volume of 47 million shares for the last month, comp=
ared with 2.1 million shares trading each day this time last year.=20
"What the market activity represents is the increasing uncertainty about wh=
ether you're going to get $10 or $11 or zero," Mr. Keller said.

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called "PACE", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Greg, Jeff and Stan:

I just received a call from David Dehaemers at Kinder, Morgan.  They are interested in buying Transwestern and offered to have Rich call Ken - but I waived that off in order to get a read from you all.

With respect to the merits, if a preferred at the pipe level is being treated as effectively debt by the rating agencies, a sale is roughly equivalent to a preferred with respect to both ratings and liquidity.  In addition, the sale should provide greater proceeds due to lower cost of funds and may have a higher probability of success.  One key issue will be funding the sale at signing or HSR rather than regulatory approval.

I first wanted to test you three, and if supportive, determine the best path upon which to proceed including gaining Dynegy's consent.

Mark, Jeff and Greg,  There has been some recent noise at CalPERS regarding Enron, some of which you may be aware.  I wanted to update you in case any questions were raised tomorrow on the conference call.

In October CA state Senator Steve Peace sent a letter to the CEO of PERS raising "questions about the prudence of CalPERS continuing to invest and partner with Enron under its current management".  I discussed this with the Alternative Investment (AIM) staff (with whom I deal with regularly regarding JEDI II).  They indicated at the time that a senior staff meeting was being held (on Friday Nov 2nd) to discuss the letter and how PERS might respond.  Subsequent to that, staff informed me that the board had put Enron on the agenda to discuss during today's (Tuesday the 13th) Investment Committee meeting.  I have not received an update as yet today on today's meeting.  The fact that the board was meeting to discuss Enron has been reported in the media.

Meanwhile, on Friday the 9th, Dan Szente the CIO resigned from PERS.  Articles indicate it may be a result of 7.2 percent loss in the funds' investments.  PERS holds approx 2.6 million shares of Enron.  This has also been mentioned in articles discussing Dan's resignation - thus attempting to link his resignation with our poor performance?? 

Earlier in the year their proxy vote indicated they owned 3.5 million shares. [BTW - they voted against Item 1 - specifically mentioning Lay, Wakeham and Winokur as having relationships with Enron that could cause conflicts of interest.}  PERS assets total $151 billion.  It appears they may have liquidated some of their position.  I am not sure but I think their position has been one they have held for a long time - possibly since beginning our relationship with JEDI back in 1993.  

The JEDI II partnership has been a successful partnership for PERS and current IRRs indicate they could earn in excess of 50% on their investment based on the September 30 capital account.  This of course, assumes we can liquidate the assets in JEDI I for their current fair value.  

Also - PERS purchased approx. 7.2 million shares in NPW for $40 million - a cost basis of $5.50 a share.  

If you have any questions, I am available this evening at 713-218-6460.
