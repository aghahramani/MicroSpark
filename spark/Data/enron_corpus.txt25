Jeff and Greg,

Operationally, we are doing great, with tremendous press coverage (USA
Today, CNN, Newsweek, Boston Globe, etc...), growing traffic, and lots of
praise for our site and concept.  On the business development front, we are
now talking seriously with eBay about a distribution arrangement and with
Northwest about expanding to their full route system.

Meanwhile, we are running out of cash.  The money we've got in the bank will
last through early August (assuming an orderly shut-down).  In order to keep
our business development efforts alive, we're trying to raise $500k at a low
valuation in the next 30 days.  Would you be willing to consider a portion
of this amount as a personal investment?

Attached is an up-to-date overview of where we stand.

Best,
Frank Levy

At Enron, we=01,re good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing=
=20
products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers =
=01)=20
the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot bett=
er=20
is watching our expenses.  We=01,re all shareholders in this company, and w=
e=20
need to spend our company=01,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make=
=20
sure we=01,re careful with Enron=01,s money.  The Policy Committee has appr=
oved and=20
recommended the following:

? Professional Services =01) This is our largest area of discretionary spen=
ding,=20
at more than $600 million last year. =01&Professional Services=018 includes=
 our=20
contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other=20
consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and=
=20
terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring al=
l=20
future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be=20
negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS),=
=20
effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be=20
pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and=20
GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

? On-line expense reporting tool XMS =01) XMS, our online expense reporting=
=20
tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July =
1,=20
all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for=20
reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to=20
http://xms.enron.com/. =20

? Enterprise wide portal =01) We currently have 122 internal web sites acro=
ss=20
the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and othe=
r=20
related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable. =
=20
It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access conte=
nt=20
and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easie=
r=20
for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new=20
company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched i=
n=20
several phases beginning this fall. =20

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is=
=20
travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As=
=20
we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating=
=20
those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advanta=
ge=20
of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and=20
booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company=
=20
without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are=
=20
common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo=
r=20
business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations=
=20
will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

? Air travel =01) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in th=
e=20
Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location -=
=20
all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by=
=20
GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking=20
service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same=20
negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book=
=20
non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than=20
refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee. =
=20
For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase=20
non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

? Lodging =01) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel=
=20
chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit=01,s=20
individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron=01,s list of pref=
erred=20
hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit=01=
,s=20
policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

? Car rental services =01) When renting a car for business travel, employee=
s=20
should use our preferred car rental agencies =01) National (U.S. and Canada=
) and=20
Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to prote=
ct=20
you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit=20
http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outsi=
de=20
the U.S.

? Off-site meetings =01) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events wit=
h=20
more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate=
=20
preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each=20
business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further=
=20
elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron=
=20
retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensib=
le=20
actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look fo=
r=20
cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If=

In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending 
Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became "inactive".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The power station and LNG contractors terminated their respective 
construction contracts over the weekend.

Rebecca McDonald and Ken Lay met with the India Minister of Finance on 
Saturday in New York.  The Minister reiterated India's position that they 
would not buy any power from Dabhol.

We had a conference call with management of GE and Bechtel last week.  There 
is little evident disagreement amongst the sponsors on key issues.  Bechtel 
even complimented Rebecca on her team and handling of the matter.  Walter 
Stuart from V&E came over to listen in on the phone call on behalf of Enron.  
Given the increasing cooperation of the sponsors and written statements of GE 
and Bechtel approving Enron's handling of ongoing issues, we have kept V&E's 
involvement fairly "low key" to date.

Acta Announces Partnership With i2; i2 Customers Can Now Choose Acta's 
Rapid-to-Implement Data Integration Products to Collaborate Intelligently 
Across the Supply Chain

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 11, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, today announced a 
technology partnership with i2 Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:ITWO), the leading 
provider of marketplace solutions. 
The partnership enables i2's TradeMatrix(TM) customers to choose Acta's data 
platform, which is designed to package and speed the delivery of the 
back-office data essential for selling, buying and collaborating online. Acta 
will develop a number of data cache solutions (Acta eCaches(TM)) to provide 
rapidly deployable, pre-packaged data content and connectivity to the 
back-office systems that fuel TradeMatrix applications. 
i2's TradeMatrix allows businesses to create both private and public 
marketplaces, while improving the efficiencies of all participants with 
content and solutions to support decision optimization for key functions 
including design, buy, plan, sell, fulfill and service. The Acta eCaches for 
TradeMatrix will enable businesses to share key back-office data with their 
customers and trading partners and provide rapid-to-implement solutions for 
integrating key B2B data from operational systems across the entire extended 
enterprise. 
Industry leaders and analysts have recognized the need for packaged solutions 
for B2B data integration -- the linchpin in a rapidly growing number of B2B 
initiatives. 
"B2B data integration is rapidly emerging as a 'must-have' technology for all 
companies who do business online. As a leader in B2B data integration and 
caching, Acta enables i2's TradeMatrix customers to grant rapid access to 
detailed and accurate data from enterprise systems," said Acta CEO Carol 
Mills Baldwin. "Now TradeMatrix customers will be able to combine i2's 
industry leading technology with the most rapid data integration solution, 
essential for conducting business collaboration online." 
The Acta/i2 partnership provides further validation that B2B data caching is 
emerging as an important new category in B2B integration. Unlike other B2B 
integration solutions -- such as application integration and process 
integration -- Acta focuses on data integration as an essential component for 
allowing companies to do business online, either through direct commerce 
sites or in marketplaces. The Acta platform consists of ActaWorks 
RealTime(TM), an award-winning data movement-and-management server, and 
eCaches(TM), a suite of packaged data caches that speed the delivery of 
back-office data in specific subject areas of eCommerce and business 
intelligence.

Subject: HOLIDAY PARTY THANKS

I wanted to thank everyone involved for the beautiful bouquet of flowers that 
I received today.  It was a pleasure working with all of you on the holiday 
party at Enron Field.  I appreciate the executives 'stepping up to the plate' 
(so to speak) when they were asked to go out on the field.  You could tell by 
the roar from the audience that they thoroughly enjoyed the banter!!  I would 
also like to thank Nicki Daw, Kim Hillis, Cathy Phillips, Jennifer Burns, Sue 
Ford, Marsha Schiller, Liz Taylor and Kay Chapman for all their efforts and 
support during the planning of this event. 

My greatest reward is knowing that everyone enjoyed the festivities.  Thanks 
again and I wish all of you a very joyous holiday season!!

don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing 
power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in 
oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in 
Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our 
fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring 
into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in 
EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are 
setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping 
origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you 
make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in 
the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's 
and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, 
structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are 
pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an 
Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant 
development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan 
or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our 
projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call 
Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessment or 
management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  We 
understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to do 
business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness 
evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does an 
instant credit check before confirming the transaction.

However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What sort 
of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizing 
EOL to purchase from Enron?

Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter 
party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron 
utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

Thank you.

Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short 
positions, the total MTM for that
day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL.
 If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is 
-5*60,000= -$300,000.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

Greg:

Kevin Hannon and I were meeting yesterday to review various organizational 
issues and one thing he asked me to do was extend a one time only offer to 
take over the assets in Europe that don't really fit with their ongoing 
business - i.e. Turkey, Poland and Sarlux.  An additional question I had is 
whether you think that EWS continues to be the correct place for EEOS.

Your thoughts?

are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=
=20
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=
=20
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil=
l=20
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=
=20
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=
=20
Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20
affected will be notified shortly.
=20
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar=
e=20
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20

CALIFORNIA  SITUATION CLARITY IMPROVING; MOST LIKELY OUTCOME FAVORABLE FOR
ALL
* While we do not expect a direct rate increase or removal of the rate
freeze for EIX or PCG out of the California Public Utility Commission
meeting today, we are encouraged by the conciliatory tone of recent
comments.
* In our view, acerbic rhetoric has finally given way to pragmatic
reconciliation and it now appears that California utilities are on the path
towards effectively receiving the rate increases they require to remain
solvent.
* We believe this has implications not only for the health of the
affected utilities, but also for the Growth Energy Merchants and Competitive
Generators.
* While the credit risk associated with utilities' power market
purchases have not been solved yet, the credit risk in the California market
has eased somewhat.
* While trading may be choppy as the final California remedy is
hammered out, we recommend the purchase of the Growth Energy names
throughout any near-term weakness possible as a result of the process.
* Decision expected today at 4:00 PM EST.

Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names

* We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
* Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
* Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
* By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.

Greg, 

You and I met at your office last summer to discuss Aprimo's Marketing 
Management Solution. At the time, you indicated that there would be other 
people at Enron that I should speak with. My assigned territory changed 
shortly after our meeting, and I did not follow-up on these contacts. I am 
once again responsible for Enron, and would appreciate your direction to the 
appropriate individuals at Enron.

Our web-based solution has been adopted by over 60 leading companies over the 
past 18 months. They are seeing rapid value from Aprimo's unique ability to 
help them Grow Top-Line Revenue (more effective Marketing) and Reduce 
Bottom-line Cost (more efficient Marketing). With the opportunities facing 
Enron, I'm certain that maximizing your Marketing Investments is of interest 
to the Executive Team and your Shareholders.

Our solution is delivering improvements across all Marketing Functions, such 
as: 

- Event Management 
- Marcom 
- Marketing Financial Management 
- Strategic Planning 
- Direct Marketing 
- Web Response 
- Lead Management

True, but the limits and associated P&L notifications relate to commodity 
groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, 
where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately 
hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and 
associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity "cut".

Loss notifications, especially, serve as a "flag", and provided the 
explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, 
can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, 
sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good 
"institutional memory".

I talked to Brent about this yesterday - my advice was that notifications 
would be better drafted by those closest to the positions (i.e. his mid 
office groups)

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

the next policy meeting to act -- if the stock market keeps falling

call liz and get on my calendar.  maybe we can grab lunch or something.  i 
heard about the ag meeting.  sounds like things could have gone better, but 
it also sounds like jeff was a little difficult.  he never has liked the 
notion of that business though.  i'll try to explain it next week.

As you may have heard, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 into law (the "Law") this morning.  The Law 
reduces personal income tax rates, modifies the AMT and Estate Tax and makes 
several changes to retirement and education savings incentives.  Further, due 
to the reduction in the personal income tax rates (through the creation of a 
new 10 percent tax bracket carved out from the previous 15 percent bracket) 
without a reduction to the amount currently withheld under the Federal 
withholding tax regime, all taxpayers are slated to receive a rebate of taxes 
that otherwise would have been paid this year - this is the $300, 500 or 600 
"tax refund" that you may have heard of in connection with the Law.  The 
attached documents describe in greater detail the changes I have just 
described.  As always, I can be reached at x30938 should you have any 
questions.  Best regards.  SHD.

Subject: Enron OnLine


Thank you for your hospitality.  There were a couple of questions I had 
regarding our visit, some of which we left you with before our return to 
Washington.

I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding 
where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However, does EOL require 
customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL collect, use or manage 
data regarding cookies?

Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades showing prices 
and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data?  If 
yes, when?

In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Networks flow to the 
risk management groups?  How is the information used?

Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL.  If yes, 
in what form and for how long?

Thanks

million, due to the additional short positions added at NP and SP.   The VaR

I would suggest that we start reporting Capital Deployed and Funds Flow 
numbers in these reports as well
as the Wholesale Group will need to take the lead in managing both.

	CheMatch.com continues auction growth
Dec 04, 2000 10:12 AM ET 
	HOUSTON, Dec. 4 (LocalBusiness.com) -- CheMatch.com said more than 95,000 
metric tons of chemicals were traded in November through its private auction 
system -- a volume equal to more than half of the total trades since the 
auction's inception last summer. 
	In a written statement, Ed Moody, CheMatch.com's vice president of auctions 
said the private auction system uses real-time pricing feedback and can be 
tailored to the needs of each user. 
	Since CheMatch.com started the private auctions, about 50 companies have 
traded more than 175,000 metric tons of products including chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products. The average value of completed transactions is 
about $800,000. 
	In addition to auctions, CheMatch.com also operates a commodity chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products exchange on which more than 1 million metric tons 
of product has been transacted. 
	CheMatch has recently completed a restructuring that included layoffs, and 
early last month it withdrew a planned initial public offering. 
	Clay Jeansonne, CheMatch.com spokesman, told LocalBusiness.com last week the 
company currently has 85 employees down from 93 and that CheMatch expects to 
bring in new funding from venture capital and technology companies by the end 
of the year. 
	Privately held CheMatch.com is an Internet-based marketplace for the buyers 
and sellers of bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products. Its 
investors currently include Battery Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY), 
Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC), DuPont (NYSE: DD), GE (NYSE: GE) and 
Millennium Chemicals (NYSE: MCH).

o Online Marketing Firm iChoose Shuts Down

DALLAS -- iChoose, a developer of e-commerce marketing
systems, said it has shut down due to lack of funding.
In the past couple of months, the company has struggled
to stay alive by seeking out additional funding,
and even signed a letter of intent to be acquired.
That  acquisition fell through and the company said
it had no other choice than to close. iChoose was
unable to disclose the would-be-acquirer due to
legal restrictions. On its Web site, the company
posted a message with uninstall instructions for
its software and a final farewell to its customers.
iChoose was backed by Sevin Rosen.

In March I left a message for you explaining that I was accepting an offer  
from ElPaso. That decision followed my having brought together the pieces of  
a project that John Nowland indicated Enron was not prepared to consider and  
my subsequent presentation of the project to ElPaso who embraced the deal. 

John indicated that the 90 day delay he inserted into our discussions  
resulted from your having considered Trammo. I understand that Trammo is no  
longer a target for Enron and wondered, therefore, if our getting together  
for an hour would be timely. 
The industry still presents a target rich environment and you are still the  
biggest horse in the race.

John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a 
press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed 
agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to 
renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long 
term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of 
litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.  

Chris

Our outside Regulatory Counsel has heard that the CPUC will definitely vote 
to suspend direct access on June 28 effective July 1.  We will be working 
through formal comments and informal discussions to clarify the meaning of 
the this suspension.

We are still working to try and modify the Proposed Decisions as they relate 
to the PX Credit receivable, with our primary focus on removing this part of 
the decision from a vote on June 28.

Subject: Network

Hi John,

I assume you spoke with Nigel following your voicemail on Friday and he has 
brought you up to date.

We are doing everything we can to make fix this problem, and we are trying to 
ensure everyone is in the loop.

The problem looks to be a software bug somewhere in the Cisco operating 
environment. This has been escalated to Cicso's highest priority and we have 
had up to 6 Cisco engineers working on the problem. We have also flown in one 
on the Houston Netwrok team to assist. The problem we have is that the two 
core 6500 routers, which are at the hub of the network will run along 
perfectly at about 7% utilization, then, for an as yet undetermined reason 
they suddenly jump to 99% and start thrashing, dropping network connectivity. 

The catch 22 we have is that when the system goes down, the Cicso guys need 
time to capture diagnostic information, but of course we just need to get it 
up again straight away.

The team have systematically gone though each hardware component and each 
software component to ensure all are working, all are at the latest cisco 
recomended release level and all are required. Those not needed are removed 
to ensure the 'simplest' environment possible.

The bottom line is that we still haven't solved the problem, but are doing 
everything in our power to resolve it ASAP.

Regards
MRP

fyi, we have been working on a network redesign since before these problems 
start which will distribute the network across more Core routers, (in effect 
seperate networks). This design is the same as that proposed for the new 
Houston building. Whatever design is in place, however, we can never rule out 
a problem due to faulty software such as this.

Greg,

I am forwarding you the notes from a regular weekly meeting with one of our 
summer interns.
He works on review of the literature regarding drivers behind bid - offer 
spreads.
Please, let me know if you would like additional info.
