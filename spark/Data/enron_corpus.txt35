regional level, H,bert is willing to consider them as one possibility among=
=20
other short-term resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California.=
=20
Reuters reported that H,bert said at the hearings that "such controls are n=
ot=20
a long-term solution and would discourage the industry from building more=
=20
power plants to supply the West." Rather, H,bert believes that power=20
generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants, both in=
=20
California and elsewhere. H,bert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as=
=20
saying, "Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand, thus=20
correcting the current imbalance. Capping prices through regulation or=20
legislation will have exactly the opposite effect."=20

Despite H,bert's opposition to wholesale price caps, fellow Commissioner=20
William Massey, a Democrat, asserted that California and the western region=
=20
were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary "time out" or price cap=
=20
was needed to let the market stabilize. "The commission must act forcefully=
=20
and decisively to reassure market participants, policymakers and consumers=
=20
that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju=
st=20
and reasonable rates," Massey said. In addition, Massey reportedly also sai=
d=20
that "such a price cap could be calculated on a generator-by-generator basi=
s=20
at each generator's variable operating cost, plus a reasonable capacity=20
adder, perhaps in the range of $25 per megawatt hour." Massey reiterated th=
e=20
severity of the crisis in California, noting that whereas wholesale power i=
n=20
the state cost $7 billion in 1999 it increased to $27 billion in 2000 and=
=20
could exceed $70 billion for 2001. =20

Rounding out the commission's divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key=20
Breathitt, a Democrat, who said that all possible options should be analyze=
d=20
and debated. Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric=
e=20
controls.=20

Chairman H,bert's stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary=20
Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration. In fact,=20
Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will "discourage investmen=
t=20
in new generation at a time when it is most needed" and drive power produce=
rs=20
to other regions of the country (and further away from California). The=20
Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price=
=20
caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California. "The=
=20
only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price=
=20
caps," Abraham said. =20

Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin=
g=20
is scheduled for later this week. Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, a Texas=
=20
Republican, noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o=
r=20
not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the=
=20
next few weeks. =20

This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE=
RC=20
over major issues facing the energy industry. The commission also became=20
divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission=
=20
organizations (RTOs). FERC's December 1999 vote on the Alliance RTO=20
illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies=
=20
that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be=20
regulated. Then-Commissioner H,bert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT=
O=20
met FERC guidelines for RTO formation, and was the sole member who=20
successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an=
=20
RTO. However, H,bert stood as a minority. The other three commissioners at=
=20
FERC at the time (Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt) preferred to wield a tight=
er=20
regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current=20
transmission policy. While H,bert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti=
es=20
and letting free market principles rule, the other commissioners at FERC=20
appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities.=20

Meanwhile, speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat=
=20
Wood III, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), to the=
=20
position of FERC chairman. H,bert was named chairman in February by Preside=
nt=20
Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican=20
administration took office Jan. 20. At that time, the president did not=20
indicate that H,bert's appointment as chair was temporary. Wood was appoint=
ed=20
by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in 1995 and played a primary role i=
n=20
the development of that state's restructuring plan. (Electric choice begins=
=20
in Texas on June 1, 2001, with the start of a pilot program and then the=20
market opens fully to competition on Jan. 1, 2002). =20

The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate=
d.=20
There are two "Republican" openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush.=
=20
As noted, presently H,bert is the only Republican among the current three=
=20
members. Wood, reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas=20
governor, has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the=20
Republican openings on FERC for some time. However, the Washington Post and=
=20
Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman, forcing=
=20
H,bert to step back into a role as commissioner. The report in Reuters=20
indicated that H,bert, a friend and prot,g, of Senate Majority Leader Trent=
=20
Lott (R-Miss.), is personally "fighting the planned move." The nomination=
=20
would require Senate confirmation.=20

Moreover, as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC, th=
e=20
issue of price caps remains unresolved. The debate over price caps also has=
=20
divided others involved, strictly along party lines. Generally speaking,=20
Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha=
t=20
has been called "price gouging" on the part of  energy companies. Republica=
ns=20
believe that the government (including FERC and the Bush administration)=20
should maintain a "hands-off" approach and allow the marketplace to determi=
ne=20
prices. Speaking from a non-partisan point of view, some economists now=20
question whether=01*and not just how=01*deregulation of electricity markets=
 should=20
occur at all. For instance, Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economis=
t=20
who helped deregulate other industries, says that electricity markets may n=
ot=20
lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in=20
retaining vertical integration among utilities (allowing a single regulated=
=20
power company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity). The movemen=
t=20
toward re-regulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate=
=20
over wholesale price caps. =20

Yet, in any event, once again California remains the catalyst for=20
decision-making on this issue. As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in=
to=20
a third day in the state, federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a=20
definitive position on wholesale price caps for California, which of course=
=20
would set a precedent for the rest of the country. As the industry's top=20
agency in charge of wholesale markets, FERC's ultimate position on price ca=
ps=20
carries tremendous influence. Despite the apparent dissension within the=20
commission and possible changes in its leadership, FERC is presently=20
challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b=
e=20
conducted, or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in this=20
area. =20

Here's the answer to your question about paragraphs 42 and 44 of Duke's 
complaint.  Although CDWR is technically the SC for the UDCs in the short 
term bilateral market and the ISO, as a practical matter, if CDWR does not 
like the prices offered in the bilateral market, it waits to buy the power 
from the ISO.  Then  CDWR reviews the price of the ISO's purchases and 
(according to an article in Megawatt daily) it "does not authorize the 
payment at prices it deems unreasonable."Message-ID: <14356490.1075860423846.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

price is good through April 30th.

 By now, you should know that attorneys can be considered debt
collectors subject to the Fair  Debt Collection Practices Act =01) even if
the attorney never sends a letter or makes a telephone call, but simply
files a lawsuit.  Litigation against attorneys under the FDCPA is
increasing nationwide, and attorneys are being held liable for even
innocent and technical violations of the FDCPA.  Attend this program to
learn the top 10 ways attorneys violate the FDCPA, and how they can
avoid the violations.  Learning even one new tip could save you in
damages many times the cost of this CLE!

Colleagues:

Please find below the first glimpse of the plan to update, and review, the 
largest 50 curves; they represent 75% of URM exposure.  I am confident of 
your cooperation and support; both are absolutely essential to complete this 
ambitious schedule on time  (the process will start on April 23rd and 
conclude by May 25th, 2001).

Stella, Pat and I are currently working on streamlining the regulatory inputs 
required from you  in a faster, and more cost-effective manner.  We are also 
working on ensuring that documentation will be compiled in a very user 
friendly database (with the help/support of Elizabeth it shall be on the 
intranet) that will make the process next time a cinch, and provide the 
required inputs for your suggested strategy for the curve/utility when the 
time comes (it is the second stage of the process).   

Stella, Pat and I shall seek your permission for an appropriate time this 
coming week to discuss the details of the plan and take stock of your 
comments and suggestions.  

Best regards

Jim, Scott:

Please find below the production schedule to update and review the regulatory 
component of the largest 50 curves (75% of net positions).  The process will 
start on April 23rd and conclude by May 25th, 2001.  The Team here is  
working very closely with Jeff and Rick to systemize the process so that we 
put the right foot forward, always, and repetitively  (90 days intervals); I 
certainly appreciate their insight, and advice.

Please let me know if you have any question, comment, or suggestion.

I hope you caught Lysa's error in transcribing this message.  I said you 
should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has not accepted 
a rate or that a rate isn't on file.  Sorry about the double negative.  FERC 
usually speaks in terms of "accepting" rates rather 
than "setting" rates unless it has had a hearing and found that the rates 
being charged are unjust and unreasonable..

Robin & Jeff:

Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she 
gave you yesterday.  

Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..."
you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate 
isn't on file".

If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone 
(503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time.

Subject: Summary of Commission Meeting


In the Commission meeting today:

GridFlorida=01,s application to form an RTO in the Florida peninsula was=20
approved with certain distinct directives. Namely, GridFlorida must improve=
=20
stakeholder participation;  must report on further developments to ensure=
=20
obligations of reliability and interface functions according to Order 2000;=
=20
and must further define the rights of passive owners understanding that any=
=20
veto rights of passive owners will be subject to review by FERC. RT01-67

Southwest Power Pool=01,s application to form an hybrid RTO is rejected. SP=
P=01,s=20
application was limited to Entergy and SPP only and therefore, has not mean=
t=20
the scope and regional configuration as directed by Order 2000. The require=
d=20
report according to the Federal Power Act, Section 203 was not filed. The=
=20
order does permit SPP to change its merger affiliation to join an RTO and=
=20
approves the filing regarding the board selection process. RT01-34

FERC is issuing a Notice, RM99-2 inviting comments from the industry  on=20
interregional coordination. A technical conference will be scheduled after=

Vicki and Mike--

It is true that the CEC "awarded" us a contract for $1.5MM of grants under 
the AB970 program.  I use quotes around the award because we had responded 
only to an RFQ, not an RFP, so the issuance of the "award" based only on an 
RFQ was unusual (perhaps due to urgency of program).  As the RFQ didn't 
include any terms and conditions, after the "award", we started negotiating 
the terms and conditions of the contract.  We have been hung up on 
consequential damages and indemnities, so on March 12 I prepared a mini-TAF 
covering these issues for executive approval.  George Hernandez' assistant 
picked up the mini-TAF on March 13.  I haven't seen it since and so I don't 
know whether the mini-TAF was fully signed or not.  George is out of the 
office and I have just left his assistant a message.  I am hopeful that no 
one has signed the actual contract pending approval of the mini-TAF.

If I can track down the status of the mini-TAF I'll re-send an email with 
status.

> throughout the state.
> 
> "Our campaign for conservation and improved energy efficiency will

> continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency."
> 
> The agreements signed by Governor Davis will account for about 93

> work by using software that automatically dim lights, reduce air
> conditioning use, and cut other electrical loads. They operate in response
> to signals from the Independent System Operator (ISO) or from an electric
> utility or service provider.
> 
> Under the agreements, commercial electricity customers will agree to shave
> peak loads by 10 to 30 percent upon receiving the signal from the ISO.
> They will be paid by the ISO to curtail electricity load in their
> buildings in real time.
> 
> In addition to these grants, the Governor also announced that an
> additional eight megawatts of electricity would be saved through grants to
> the K-Mart Corporation. K-Mart will use a $2 million grant to replace old
> lighting fixtures with energy efficient ones in its 85 California stores.
> 
> The demand responsive program and the innovative efficiency and renewables
> program covering the K-Mart grant are parts of AB 970, which was passed
> last year. The bill is designed to reduce at least 220 megawatts of peak
> load by June 1, 2001. 
> 
> The Governor has proposed an additional $70 million in his New Demand
> Reduction Initiative program that would yield an additional 160 megawatts
> in savings from demand responsive building systems. 
> 
> For more information, please contact the California Energy Commission.
> 
> Demand Responsive Contracts:
> 1. Sacramento Municipal Utility District, $882,750, target savings: 10

Jim.  I like your suggestions and suggest the following enhancements:
We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process. ie Keep rate freez=
e=20
in effect until the Mar 02.  Make state agency take over as ESP to all=20
bundled customers at 110% of frozen rate.  This solution keeps the current=
=20
Rate Freeze in place and keeps us in the game to not lose our negative ctc.=
 =20
It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal.  It also puts government=
=20
agency in the same place as us in having exposure to negative ctc as us.  I=
t=20
also accomodates the problem of RFP's taking longer than expected.  It also=
=20
solves the liquidity problem immediately and avoids the need for=20
forbearance.  And furthermore it keeps the utility exposed to bankruptcy=20
which minimizes their negotiating power.
I don't understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existin=
g=20
assets of PG&E.  The worry I have is that PG&E gets to keep 50% of the=20
benefits of nuclear sales and 10% of the benefits of hydro sales, post rate=
=20
freeze.  If we damage 1890, the utilities are now in the drivers seat.
re "ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average=20
generation rate from 1/1/01 =01) 12/31/02 to serve any competitive load in=
=20
California"  This suggest a replacement to AB 1890 which suggests significa=

Great idea.  My strategy was solve the immediate problem of solvency quickl=
y=20
by getting the government to step in while the rules of the RFP are defined=
,=20
then do the auction, but if you think we could go straight to an RFP for=20

I believe that we do not have time for an RFP (6 months) so that we should=

get the government entity to step in to give us the time.

And auction by rate class would be good but noone would want the large=20
classes because their rate increase will be higher and they will be less=20
likely to stay.

What about something different?

If we asked for an Auction by rate class that would allow a different compa=
ny=20
to market the default service.  The competitive bids would be used to reduc=
e=20
the overall undercollection.  So in your ST point #1, replace Government=20

At Enron, we=01,re good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing=
=20
products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers =
=01)=20
the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot bett=
er=20
is watching our expenses.  We=01,re all shareholders in this company, and w=
e=20
need to spend our company=01,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make=
=20
sure we=01,re careful with Enron=01,s money.  The Policy Committee has appr=
oved and=20
recommended the following:

? Professional Services =01) This is our largest area of discretionary spen=
ding,=20
at more than $600 million last year. =01&Professional Services=018 includes=
 our=20
contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other=20
consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and=
=20
terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring al=
l=20
future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be=20
negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS),=
=20
effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be=20
pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and=20
GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

? On-line expense reporting tool XMS =01) XMS, our online expense reporting=
=20
tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July =
1,=20
all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for=20
reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to=20
http://xms.enron.com/. =20

? Enterprise wide portal =01) We currently have 122 internal web sites acro=
ss=20
the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and othe=
r=20
related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable. =
=20
It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access conte=
nt=20
and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easie=
r=20
for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new=20
company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched i=
n=20
several phases beginning this fall. =20

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is=
=20
travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As=
=20
we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating=
=20
those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advanta=
ge=20
of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and=20
booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company=
=20
without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are=
=20
common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo=
r=20
business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations=
=20
will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

? Air travel =01) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in th=
e=20
Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location -=
=20
all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by=
=20
GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking=20
service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same=20
negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book=
=20
non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than=20
refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee. =
=20
For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase=20
non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

? Lodging =01) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel=
=20
chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit=01,s=20
individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron=01,s list of pref=
erred=20
hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit=01=
,s=20
policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

? Car rental services =01) When renting a car for business travel, employee=
s=20
should use our preferred car rental agencies =01) National (U.S. and Canada=
) and=20
Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to prote=
ct=20
you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit=20
http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outsi=
de=20
the U.S.

? Off-site meetings =01) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events wit=
h=20
more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate=
=20
preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each=20
business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further=
=20
elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron=
=20
retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensib=
le=20
actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look fo=
r=20
cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If=
=20
you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please=20
e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions=
=20
and answers about these policies is posted on=20
http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional=20
questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on=20
Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving=20
recommendations.Message-ID: <715914.1075860423144.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Joe Eisenberg has said much the same thing to one of our clients, saying
that the PX filed, not the trust, and the the bankruptcy relates only to the
PX in its own capacity and not as trustee.  Eisenberg plans to file some
sort of motion soon to clarify this.

Subject: Re: Response to PX Answer to Chargeback Complaint


I spoke with Lisa Urich, in-house attorney for the PX.  She said that the
bankruptcy filing did not list the collateral or dollars received as part of
the PX's clearinghouse function as assets, and has been advised by the PX's
bankruptcy attorney that they are not involved in the bankruptcy action.
She said that the purpose of the bankruptcy filing relates only to vendors.

>>> Jeffrey Watkiss 03/12/01 02:07PM >>>
The Chapter 11 filing, I suspect, will receive a lot of attention on the
3:00 pm call.

>>> "Howard Shapiro" <HES@vnf.com> 03/12/01 12:24PM >>>
Thanks for the draft.  We are informed that the PX has filed in Chapter 11.
It may argue that FERC's proceedings fall within the automatic stay, and
that even if they don't, the accounting we are proposing inappropriately
overlaps the role of the bankruptcy court.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy

DATE: March 26, 2001

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on FERC Order Removing
      Obstacles
      ? Conference Call on Wed., March 28th at 2:00 p.m. (EST)
      ? Filing Due on Friday, March 30th

On March 14, 2001, FERC issued an "Order Removing Obstacles To Increased 
Electric Generation And Natural Gas Supply In the Western United States And 
Requesting Comments On Further Actions To Increase Energy Supply And Decrease 
Energy Consumption" (Order).  The Order announced certain actions the 
Commission is taking to promote electric generation supply and delivery in 
the United States' portion of the Western Interconnection, requesting 
comments on those and other, related proposals by March 30th.

Attached are EPSA's draft comments in response to the Commission's Order.  As 
discussed on the last conference call, we endorse many of the Commission's 
proposals, although stressing that infrastructure investment and seamless 
regional markets are the ultimate solutions to California's problems.  We 
also encourage the Commission to take additional steps to allow QF sales into 
the market.

Please review the attached draft and forward any comments or suggestions to 
Julie Simon at EPSA at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org as soon as possible.  
We will discuss the draft comments on our conference call this Wednesday , 
March 28th, at 2:00 p.m. (EST). To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask 
for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.

Sue,

I noticed Hoecker's statement too.  I do not, however, believe that he is 
breaking new legal ground here, although the reference to Section 309 is (I 
believe) the first time in these cases that FERC or any of the individual 
Commissioners cited specifically to this section of the FPA as possible 
authority for ordering retroactive refunds prior to the 10/2/00 "refund 
effective date."  (I have attached Hoecker's opinion; the reference to 
Section 309 is on page 11.)

Section 309 is the provision of the FPA that grants FERC authority to take 
action "necessary and proper" to carry out the other substantive provisions 
of the Act, such as ensuring "just and reasonable" rates under Section 206 of 
the Federal Power Act; however, the courts have interpreted Sec. 309 as not 
expanding FERC's substantive authority otherwise granted under other 
provisions of the Act; it only provides FERC with authority as necessary for 
it to fill in the "missing blanks" in the substantive provisions of the Act, 
such as Sec. 206.)

Several years ago, FERC ordered retroactive refunds in a Washington Water 
Power case where the utility had violated its tariff.  Here, Hoecker is 
simply suggesting that FERC could do the same if it turns out that any seller 
violated the ISO's or PX's tariff last summer by engaging in "collusion, 
predatory pricing, or unlawful manipulation of prices."  As long as EPMI 
followed  the ISO's and PX's market rules last summer, I see nothing in 
Hoecker's opinion that undermines our view that the filed rate doctrine 
prevents refunds of all amounts collected in accordance with the market rules 
prior to 10/2/00; i.e., in the absence of a violation of the tariff or FPA, 
nothing in Hoecker's opinion suggests that Sec. 309 modifies the prohibition 
of Sec. 206 against retroactive refunds prior to the refund effective date 
(10/2/00).

Dan and/or Ron,

Hoecker is quoted here as saying (p.2) that FERC has all the authority it
needs to "disgorge" profits under Section 309 of the FPA.  What are your
thoughts?  Is this the first time that section has been mentioned?

California Legislators Seek Ouster
Of State's Top Utilities Regulator

By Mitchel Benson and John Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- With blackouts again rolling across the state and 
lawmakers losing faith in Gov. Gray Davis, legislators called for the 
resignation of the state's top utility regulator and threatened to cut off 
further money for buying electricity.

The second straight day of blackouts, in which power had to be cut to the 
equivalent of 500,000 homes, resulted from a combination of unseasonably warm 
temperatures and a high-level of power-plant outages. Those factors are 
likely to worsen as a warm spring turns to a hot summer, and Californians 
switch on air conditioning.

The continuing crisis, originally sparked by a utility-deregulation plan gone 
awry, is draining the patience of political and business leaders, who are 
stepping up their criticisms of Gov. Davis. Tuesday, Assembly Republican 
Leader Bill Campbell of Orange County called on Mr. Davis's appointee, Public 
Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, to resign, and for the governor 
to "replace her with an energy expert in which Californians could have 
complete confidence."

Ms. Lynch, an attorney, had no background in energy or utilities when the 
governor appointed her as PUC chief a year ago, long before any blackouts.

"We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving this energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead," Mr. Campbell wrote 
the governor in a letter released Tuesday. "Leaders seek to eliminate 
barriers to progress. Loretta Lynch stands in the way of a quick solution to 
California's energy problem."

Mr. Campbell and other Assembly Republicans attacked Ms. Lynch for delaying 
"critical decision-making." In recent weeks, the PUC has been trying to 
determine how to divide current retail electricity revenues among utilities, 
their creditors and the state. The commission's decision is considered 
critical to the success of the state's ability to sell an estimated $10 
billion in bonds to help finance continuing electricity purchases. The 
Republicans say the PUC's inaction has put the bond issue "in jeopardy and 
Californians at higher risk of rolling blackouts." The PUC is expected to 
take up this matter again next week.

Ms. Lynch couldn't be reached for comment, but Steven Maviglio, a spokesman 
for Mr. Davis, dismissed the complaints. Pointing out that the state's flawed 
deregulation plan is based on legislation signed by then-GOP Gov. Pete Wilson 
in 1996, Mr. Maviglio said, "If the Republicans want to continue to play 
politics, good luck and God bless. I think Republicans are bankrupt of ideas, 
and instead of offering constructive solutions, they're playing games."

California's legislative plan to deregulate electricity has been derailed by 
several flaws, including the fact that wholesale rates were allowed to 
escalate while retail rates were frozen for several years. At the same time, 
the state experienced an expansion that sent demand soaring while no new 
generating capacity was added.

It's not only Republicans who are putting additional heat on the governor and 
the PUC. Sen. Steve Peace, a Democrat who is chairman of the Joint 
Legislative Budget Committee, is balking at the latest request by the 
administration for emergency electricity funding, saying he fears there isn't 
yet any mechanism in place for the state to be repaid.

On Monday, state finance director Tim Gage requested another $500 million, 
his sixth such request since Feb. 5. Mr. Gage said the Davis administration 
is "sympathetic to the senator's concerns, and we are hopeful that the PUC 
will act appropriately to resolve them."

As recriminations rose in Sacramento, officials in Los Angeles and Long Beach 
took aim at natural-gas suppliers. City attorneys filed suits in state court 
against units of Sempra Energy and El Paso Corp. claiming they conspired to 
manipulate gas supplies to drive up prices and eliminate competition. The 
cities are seeking injunctions and monetary damages.

In recent months, natural-gas prices in California have soared higher than in 
the rest of the country. Beyond the impact on gas consumers, the trend has 
put upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices, since gas is a major 
power-plant fuel.

A spokesman for El Paso said it hadn't yet been formally notified of the 
cities' suits, but in response to private suits last December alleging 
conspiracy, it issued an "unequivocal denial" of the claims. A Sempra 
spokesman couldn't be reached.

Hello --

I just wanted to confirm that the work of the PRRQ has been suspended until
further notice.  (At a minimum the meetings in April will not take place.)
In April, the RTO West Stage 2 Development Process will focus on congestion
management, contract conversion, liability issues, and limited seams work
(although there might some other isolated activity as well).

Thanks!  I look forward to when the PRRQ restarts!  Kristi

Depending on how negotiations go with Sierra, at the end of the month, we may 
need to make a FERC filing for interconnection and transmission service.

Subject: Questions you requested

Joshua:  

I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC so 
believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional 
materials, just let me know.



In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of 
any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing with 
the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California 
Independent System Operator:

Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the "air traffic controller" for the 
interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets 
access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that 
helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.  
When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a "stakeholder" 
management board was created that represented a wide range of market 
interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc.  
After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as 
too splintered and indecisive.  In a response to this perception and in an 
effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state 
legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that 
serves at the request of the California Governor.

QUESTION:  The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from 
one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California 
Governor.  Given that California is a critical part of a larger western 
regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs are 
reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?

ANSWER:  We really can't.  Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.  
However, the "traffic controller" role becomes crucial when the power crunch 
comes.  Every market participant needs to be worried that, during times of 
real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to shoot first 
and ask questions later.  Companies with firm transactions involving 
out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial interests 
sacrificed to prevent local political problems.  Instead of robust, 
competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions practically 
guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.

Robin and I discussed this same point and agree that the March 9 order should 
be brought to the court's attention.

>>> Ronald Carroll 03/14/01 04:10PM >>>
Richard:  In connection with EPMI's contention in the various California 
litigations that they should be dismissed due to FERC's primary jurisdiction, 
it strikes me that it may be helpful to lodge FERC's March 9, 2001 order with 
the Court.  While FERC, in the 12/15 order, established its investigation, 
the March 9 order makes findings and imposes remedies (fortunately not 
against us).  This should enhance the primary jurisdiction argument.  FERC's 
intent to occupy the field could not be more clear.  Ron

Thanks for the draft.  We are informed that the PX has filed in Chapter 11.  
It may argue that FERC's proceedings fall within the automatic stay, and that 
even if they don't, the accounting we are proposing inappropriately overlaps 
the role of the bankruptcy court.Message-ID: <31284646.1075860427331.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

MEMORANDUM

       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy

RE: Regulatory Affairs Washington Staff
      ? First Meeting Scheduled for Thursday, March 29th at
        Noon

Members have asked that EPSA begin coordinating regular meetings for the 
regulatory staff of our member companies here in Washington, D.C.  Like we do 
for the legislative affairs staff, EPSA would plan twice-a-month informal 
meetings to provide opportunities to share information and discuss strategy 
and tactics.  The group will not develop EPSA policy.

The first meeting of the group will be held at the new EPSA office on 
Thursday, March 29th at noon.  Lunch will be provided.  The office is located 
at 1401 New York Ave., N.W., 11th floor.  The agenda will include 
organizational issues, including future meeting format and schedules.

If you are planning to attend, please RSVP using the form below to Jackie 
Gallagher either by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).

Regulatory Affairs Washington Staff

_____  Yes, I will attend the March 29th meeting

it (1) seeks information that is not relevant and (2) seeks information that 
is unduly burdensome to produce.  (Rules of Procedure Governing Rate 
Hearings, Section 1010.8(b).)  PacifiCorp further objects to this Data 
Request on the grounds that it is in improper form, as it does not cite to

sought will be put.  (Special Rules of Practice, WP-02-O-01.)  Without 
waiving the foregoing objections, we respond as follows in the below attached

Reg Folks -- Per our conversation on the RTO conference call this am, please 
make sure and run the proposed details/rules of any real time market you are 
working on by Kevin Presto and Tim Belden before Enron agrees or proposes 
anything.  Kevin wants to have the generation curve and demand curve 
available.   However, there are many ways to set up such a market and the 
traders need to be involved (maybe with another meeting later).  For example, 
there are different ways of the dispatcher responding to bids, such as set 
point dispatch or sending out a price signal (what PJM does)--(probably many 
other methods too.)  In addition, Kevin does not like the way that NY can 
take out of merit generators. 

Let's make sure and keep the communication between our reg groups and with 
the traders flowing on these issues.  THANKS.Message-ID: <28472185.1075860397534.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

CONFIDENTIAL  ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT

Sue, Joe, Mary:

As you can see from my other email, I took a wack at supplementing the 
EPSA/WPTF comments with some additional stuff on hyrdro.

I will try to get Tim Belden's read on whether my insert is important or not 
to include but I would appreciate your feedback too.

Re: EPSA's draft: It is very good.  My only comment is that, beginnign on p. 
3,  EPSA should more directly attack the concept of economic witholding.  
There really is no such thing (or it really is not different that physical 
witholding).  If you raise your price above the opportunity cost in the 
market, your buyer will go to that other resource and thus you won't be able 
to economically withold.

Re: WPTF, I am not sure what to say.  I apologize that I had not read 
carefully before our 1 pm call but the version I reviewed has some issues. I 
just don't think it will be received that well by the FERC staff. Other than 
amplifying the credit issue (probably in there at Sue's request) I am hard 
pressed to know why Enron would support it seperate from EPSA.

We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:

Enron Global Assets and Services

In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesse=
s,=20
we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services=20
(EGAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim=
=20
Hughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Offi=
ce=20
of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which wil=
l=20
remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron India=
=20
(discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of th=
e=20
former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS will=20
include Enron=01,s assets and merchant activities in South America.  In ord=
er to=20
ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant business=
,=20
John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities.  John=
=20
will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merchant=20
business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services Offic=
e=20
of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Executive=20
Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron=01,s significant interests in India are commanding increased attentio=
n=20
from Enron=01,s senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca=
=20
McDonald will focus exclusively on Enron=01,s business in India, as Chief=
=20
Executive Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of th=
e=20
Chairman.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin=01,s departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also=
=20
making a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be=
=20
President and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Roman=
o=20
and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within=
=20
their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Offic=
er=20
of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of the=
=20
Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network=20
Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Office=
=20
of the Chairman.


Enron Principal Investments

In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities relat=
ed=20
to Enron=01,s core businesses, we are combining the existing investment gro=
ups=20
in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Group in=
to=20
a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investments wi=
ll=20
work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and manage equity=
=20
investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.  These=
=20
investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-outs,=20
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new busines=
s=20
unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will report to=
=20
an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and Greg=20
Whalley.=20

Enron Corporate Development

In order to improve coordination of Enron=01,s corporate development activi=
ties,=20
we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of=
=20
Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across=20
Enron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dua=
l=20
reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff.

One of Enron=01,s most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets =
or=20
businesses that are no longer core operations.  Mark Metts, Executive Vice=
=20
President of Enron Corp., will head up a new Special Projects group to=20
specifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging=20
transactions. =20

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new=20
responsibilities.Message-ID: <9532932.1075860390396.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Attention Enpower Users,

We are currently experiencing server connectivity issues with Deal Blotter's 
blotter server when using your local version of Enpower.  Until this problem 
is resolved, Deal Blotter will only be accessible through Terminal Server.  I 
will send a follow-up email as soon as this issue is resolved or when an ETA 
has been determined.
